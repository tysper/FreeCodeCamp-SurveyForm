<h1> FreeCodeCamp - Survey Form</h1>
<p>This is the second project from Free Code Camp.</p>

<p>The main goal of this project is to practice the skills learnt on "Responsive Web Designs". I have to build a simple, non-functional (yet... hehe) survey form. The sample project looks like this: <a href="https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/VPaoNP" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp's Version</a></p>
<p>I will update as soon as I finish my version üòä</p>

I'm almost finishing the form from scratch, my code got pretty messy, but for now I don't have to worry about it, just at the end, hopefully.. I created some random logo to make it less like FreeCodeCamp example, I thinks is getting nice, I hope that at the end I can fix all the problems on the layout, and also make my code cleaner because rn... Ok, till next day. üëã

I decided to redo all the css structure because it was too messy, now I let it very organized and clean, also made some changes to the design, still it is missing some details that I will add to it, but I hope by tomorrow it is already finished.

It took me 3 days, but yeah I am pretty satisfied with the final result, the design changed a little, and I kinda prefer this last version. After facing some challenges on the first version, I decided to redo the StylheSheet. Here are the concepts that I used to build this project:

- CSS Box Model
- HTML Semantics
- CSS Grid
- Responsive Layout
- Some basic UX principles

And that's all, I won't be updating this anymore because I am already going to the next, hehe üòÅ
